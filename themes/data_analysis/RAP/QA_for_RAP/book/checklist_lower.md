# Lower quality assurance

## Quality assurance checklist

### Modular code

- Individual pieces of logic are written as functions. Classes are used if more appropriate.
- Repetition in the code is minimalised. For example, by moving reusable code into functions or classes.

### Good coding practices

- Names used in the code are informative and concise.
- Code logic is clear and avoids unnecessary complexity.
- Code follows a standard style, e.g. [PEP8 for Python](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) and [Google](https://google.github.io/styleguide/Rguide.html) or [tidyverse](https://style.tidyverse.org/) for R.
<!-- Do we want to leave this in? These are external links but are to the main code sites so may not change? Alternatively could link them in additional resources with a caveat about them being owned by Python/R and may change?  -->

### Project structure

- A clear, standard directory structure is used to separate input data, outputs, code and documentation.

### Code documentation

- Comments are used to describe why code is written in a particular way, rather than describing what the code is doing.
- Comments are kept up to date, so they do not confuse the reader.
- Code is not commented out to adjust which lines of code run.
- All functions and classes are documented to describe what they do, what inputs they take and what they return.
- Python code is [documented using docstrings](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/). R code is [documented using `roxygen2` comments](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/roxygen2/vignettes/roxygen2.html).

### Project documentation

- A README file details the purpose of the project, basic installation instructions, and examples of usage.
- Where appropriate, guidance for prospective contributors is available including a code of conduct.
- If the code's users are not familiar with the code, desk instructions are provided to guide lead users through example use cases.
- The extent of analytical quality assurance conducted on the project is clearly documented.
- Assumptions in the analysis and their quality are documented next to the code that implements them. These are also made available to users.
- Copyright and licenses are specified for both documentation and code.
- Instructions for how to cite the project are given.

### Version control

- Code is version controlled (e.g. using Git)
- Code is committed regularly, preferably when a discrete unit of work has been completed.
- An appropriate branching strategy is defined and used throughout development.
- Code is open-sourced. Any sensitive data are omitted or replaced with dummy data.

### Configuration

- Credentials and other secrets are not written in code but are configured as environment variables.
- Configuration is clearly separated from code used for analysis, so that it is simple to identify and update.
- The configuration used to generate particular outputs, releases and publications is recorded.

### Data management

<!-- - Published outputs meet [accessibility regulations](https://analysisfunction.civilservice.gov.uk/area_of_work/accessibility/). -->
- All data for analysis are stored in an open format, so that specific software is not required to access them.
- Input data are stored safely and are treated as read-only.
- Input data are versioned. All changes to the data result in new versions being created, or changes are recorded as new records.
- All input data is documented in a data register, including where they come from and their importance to the analysis.
- Outputs from your analysis are disposable and are regularly deleted and regenerated while analysis develops. Your analysis code is able to reproduce them at any time.
- Non-sensitive data are made available to users. If data are sensitive, dummy data is made available so that the code can be run by others.
- Data quality is monitored.

### Peer review

- Peer review is conducted and recorded near to the code. Merge or pull requests are used to document review, when relevant.

### Testing

- Core functionality is unit tested as code. See [`pytest` for Python](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/) and [`testthat` for R](https://testthat.r-lib.org/).
- Code based tests are run regularly, ideally being automated using continuous integration.
- Bug fixes include implementing new unit tests to ensure that the same bug does not reoccur.
- Informal tests are recorded near to the code.
- Stakeholder or user acceptance sign-offs are recorded near to the code.

### Dependency management

- Required passwords, secrets and tokens are documented, but are stored outside of version control.
- Required libraries and packages are documented, including their versions.
- Working operating system environments are documented.
- Example configuration files are provided.

### Logging

- Misuse or failure in the code produces informative error messages.
- Code configuration is recorded when the code is run.

### Project management

- The roles and responsibilities of team members are clearly defined.
- An issue tracker (e.g GitHub Project, Trello or Jira) is used to record development tasks.
- New issues or tasks are guided by usersâ€™ needs and stories.
- Acceptance criteria are noted for issues and tasks. Fulfilment of acceptance criteria is recorded.
