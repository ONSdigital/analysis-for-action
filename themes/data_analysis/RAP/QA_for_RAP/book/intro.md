# Quality assurance of code for analysis and research

This guidance outlines software engineering good practices for writing and producing Reproducible Analytical Pipelines (RAP) for data and analysis, and provides quality assurance methods for this. This guidance builds upon the information in 'Introduction to RAP' and real life examples from 'RAP in Action'. 

You can use this guidance as a book to learn more on good practices, or refer to specific chapters to guide you in your coding and analytical workflows.
You can also find training for many of these good practices in [](learning.md).

While the principles in this guidance are computer language agnostic, examples have been provided for **Python** and **R**, as these open source languages are commonly applied across government.

## Outcomes

By guidance will help you to:

* gain an understanding of quality assurance processes and how to apply them to coding best practice. 

* write code to automate parts of your work and quality assure that the code is working as expected. 

* develop statistical or data engineering pipelines and assure that they are sustainable and reproducible.  

* develop models and assure that they are transparent and reproducible.  

* develop data science techniques for code to be useful and useable by others.  

* have a high-level introduction to software engineering practices in the context of analysis and research.
