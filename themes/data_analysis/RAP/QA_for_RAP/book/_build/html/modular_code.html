<h1>Modular code<a class="headerlink" href="#modular-code" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h1>
<p>This chapter outlines principles that represent good practices for general programming and software development.
These have been tailored to support analytical workflows.</p>
<div class="admonition-learning admonition">
<p class="admonition-title">Pre-requisites</p>
<p>You will get the most benefit from this chapter, if you understand and are comfortable with core programming concepts such as:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>storing information in variables</p></li>
<li><p>using control flow, such as if-statements and for-loops.</p></li>
<li><p>writing code as functions or classes.</p></li>
<li><p>using functions or classes in your code.</p></li>

<section id="motivation">
<h2>Motivation<a class="headerlink" href="#motivation" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>Even experienced programmers can find it difficult to understand code that is repetitive, disorganised, or overly complex.
This makes assuring, testing or changing the code more difficult.
You may also find it harder to spot and fix mistakes.</p>
<p>Code that is not modular can cause a range of issues:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>walls of repetitive code that are hard to absorb.</p></li>
<li><p>long, complex scripts that are hard to follow.</p></li>
<li><p>over-complicated code where a simpler solution could be used.</p></li>
<li><p>a code base that makes it difficult to find what you are looking for.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This chapter highlights ways to write modular code that is easy to read, review, and maintain.
These practices will also help you implement the other good coding practices you will come across in this guidance, such as version control, review, testing and documentation.
Because of this, modular code is fundamental to making analysis more reproducible, auditable and assured.</p>
</section>
<section id="modular">
<span id="id1"></span><h2>Modular code<a class="headerlink" href="#modular" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>Improving readability often involves breaking your code down into smaller, more manageable chunks.
Regardless of the language, you can group your code into self-contained parts such as modules, classes, or functions.</p>
<section id="write-re-usable-code-as-functions">
<span id="functions"></span><h3>Write re-usable code as functions<a class="headerlink" href="#write-re-usable-code-as-functions" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>In the early stages of analysis, it is common to copy and paste code to ‘make it work’. As the code matures, it is worth taking repetitive code and turning it into functions.
Functions allow a piece of logic to be made reusable in a consistent and readable way, and also makes it easier to <a class="reference internal" href="testing_code.html"><span class="std std-doc">test logic</span></a>.</p>
<p>When starting to write functions, you should consider what is the right level of complexity for a single function.
A helpful starting point is to consider if the code containing the logic can be turned into a concise and readable function. Signs that the code is too complex to work as a single function are that the function is very long or you have to pass it lots of arguments to get it to work.
If this is what you find, it is usually best to break the code into multiple smaller functions. You can
then use these smaller functions to build up a larger high-level function that performs the group of actions that you need.
Smaller functions also have the advantage that you might also be able to re-use them in other places in your code. For example, in other high-level functions that perform similar tasks.</p>
<p>This approach helps you break complex logic down into small, understandable chunks that can be documented and tested more easily.</p>
<p>When writing functions, it is also important to consider how they interact with other parts of your code.
As a general rule of thumb, your code should run in the same way if a call to your function was replaced by the value that it would have returned.
This is called ‘referential transparency’.</p>
<p>In practice, this means that your functions should not depend on or affect variables that have not been explicitly fed into them as arguments.
For instance, a function should not add columns to a data table that has not been passed as an input to the function. It should not assume that data or other functionality exists if they have not been supplied as arguments or explicitly referenced from other libraries.
Nor should the action of a function be affected by anything other than arguments that are passed to it.
For example, running your function twice with the same inputs <strong>should always produce the same results.</strong></p>
<p>Avoiding these behaviours makes your code more transparent;
it is easier for users and developers to understand which functions affect which data without being concerned about hidden behaviours.
This then makes it easier to locate bugs in the code and assure its function by peer review.</p>
<p>When it is not possible or practical to follow these practices, you should ensure that any ‘side-effects’ are adequately documented for both users and developers.
This may be the case where your code interacts with a file, database or an external service.
Ultimately, signalling where these kind of things might happen, helps someone trying to debug issues know where to look.</p>
<div class="admonition-note admonition">
<p class="admonition-title">To summarise</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Make sure that functions are not overcomplicated;
break down your code into smaller functions and build up your functionality with larger functions from these small building blocks.</p></li>
<li><p>Minimise the ‘side-effects’ of functions in order to make sure that your code is easy to debug and is transparent in its functionality.</p></li>
<li><p>Strive to make sure that running your function with the same inputs will produce the same results every time.</p></li>

<section id="group-data-and-methods-as-classes">
<h3>Group data and methods as classes<a class="headerlink" href="#group-data-and-methods-as-classes" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>Classes are a core part of <a class="reference internal" href="glossary.html#object-oriented-programming-oop"><span class="std std-ref">object-orientated programming (OOP)</span></a>.
They create an association between data (attributes of the class) and logic (methods of the class).</p>
<p>Although classes exist in R, writing custom classes is less common than it is in Python (and other OOP enabling languages) [1].
Because of this, the following sub-section will focus primarily on <strong>Python classes</strong>. If you are coding in R, you may wish to <a class="reference internal" href="#split-complex-code-into-multiple-scripts">move to the next section.</a>. Training on OOP can be found in the learning resources chapter.</p>
<p><strong>Classes are not a requirement when developing RAPs.</strong> However, they can be useful to help make code more organised and maintainable in complex pipelines. For example, they can be useful when representing real-world objects in your code and simplifying complex systems by hiding low-level details from users, such as an internal state.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>An object’s ‘state’ is usually a set of variables that are particular to a given instance of a class.
To illustrate, imagine a patient record that is represented by a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Record</span></code> class.
You can have many instances of this class (many unique patient record), each defined by the following internal state:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Indiviudal name</p></li>
<li><p>Patient number</p></li>
<li><p>Number of appointments</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>When writing classes consider marking such states as ‘private’, since the end user does not need to know all the states associated with an object. This prevents users from accessing attributes directly, instead accessing them through class methods.</p>
<div class="admonition-method-vs-function admonition">
<p class="admonition-title">Method vs Function</p>
<p>Methods in this context refer to functions that are strictly ‘attached’ to a given class.</p>
</div>
<p>In some languages ‘private’ state can be used to prevent access to parts of your class. In Python truly private instance variables do not exist [2], so it is not possible to prevent access to any part of your class. The standard convention in Python is to prefix attribute names with a single underscore (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">_my_class_attribute</span></code>) to indicate that users shouldn’t be concerned with these attributes. You can also use the same naming convention to indicate that a method is ‘private’ and should not be used by users.</p>
<div class="admonition caution">
<p class="admonition-title">Caution</p>
<p>In Python, the notion of ‘private’ does not mean secure.
The main goal of private attributes and methods is to expose less unnecessary information to the anyone using your class in their code.</p>
</div>
<p>When using classes in code, the methods a class provides are more important than what type it is defined as. This is known as ‘duck typing’; if a class has the same methods as another class, then you can use either class in your code.</p>
<p>Object-Orientated Programming introduces the concept of inheritance, where a class can ‘inherit’ methods from another class to extend it. In this situation, a new class ‘subclasses’ the ‘parent’ that it is inheriting from. When defining multiple classes with similar functionality, inheritance can be used to store the shared logic in a separate class type, which you can then extend by subclassing.</p>
<p>You can apply this similarly to functions. If you were to increase the domain and range of a function, to account for new cases, then this function should observe the same interface as the previous function.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>In short:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>You should be able to replace objects with instances of their subclasses, without altering the correctness of that program.</p></li>
<li><p>You should be able to replace functions with similar functions that share the same interface.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>However, note that inheritance locks your class into the object it inherits from. If the superclass changes, your class is forced to change with it.</p>
<p>In OOP, an ‘interface’ can be defined to act as a blueprint or specification for writing classes. An interface outlines the attributes and methods that a class must provide to be considered equivalent to a group of classes.</p>
<p>Perhaps you want to use classes to read and write data - this might require several different classes, with read and write methods for different file formats. For example, one class could deal with storing data in a database, and another could store data in local .csv files instead. In your code, you could switch which class is provided to downstream functions. Your functions don’t need to know if they are reading or writing from databases or .csv files, however, they do require the read and write methods of the class to work in a standard way. An interface would help to define the standard for interacting with this group of classes.</p>
<p>In Python, the abc module allows you to define ‘abstract’ base classes and methods to enforce that your classes provide the required methods [3]. When a subclass does not implement the required abstract methods, instances of the class cannot be created. These abstract base classes achieve the same as interfaces in other object-based languages. This concept is illustrated in the following example:</p>

<p>When multiple classes have a similar application programming interface (API, i.e. the methods they supply for users), you can easily switch between them.</p>
<p>A good real-world example of this can be seen in the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">scikit-learn</span></code> package, where the different linear model types are represented by different classes. Each linear model class supports a common set of methods, e.g. fit() and predict(). As such, you can use any model in a pipeline and swap them out with minimal effort. Therefore, when thinking about how to break you code up into classes, consider the use of standardised methods across similar objects to make them interchangeable.</p>
<div class="admonition note" id="class-responsibilities">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>As the complexity of your code grows you might find that one of your classes takes on the majority of the underlying logic. When most of your code resides in a single class, this can indicate that this class is responsible for too much of your code’s logic. This class might become overly complex and hence difficult to maintain.  This is known as ‘Data Driven Design’. For more complex analytical work, a better approach might be ‘Responsibility Driven Design’. Here, classes are smaller with more specific responsibilities. This reduces complexity and helps classes to avoid being affected by changes to other, unrelated parts of your code. However, be aware of the trade-off between the complexity of one large class versus many smaller classes.</p>
</div>
<p>Responsibility Driven Design makes objects that are usually ‘passive’ become ‘active’.</p>
<div class="admonition tip">
<p class="admonition-title">Tip</p>
<p>Many Design Patterns are available with OOP.
These are reusable solutions to common problems.</p>
</div>
<p>To summarise:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Classes hide implementation detail from users, enabling implementation to be changed without affecting users.</p></li>
<li><p>You should look to use consistent methods in a group of related classes, so that you can switch between them without affecting the code using it. You should consider Python ‘duck typing’ or abstract classes and methods.</p></li>
<li><p>You should avoid storing all logic in a single class. Instead, distribute logic between smaller classes based on specific responsibilities.</p></li>
<li><p>Be aware of trading maintainability for complexity - one large class or too many classes can be hard to understand.</p></li>
<li><p>You will find Design Patterns a useful toolbox as they have solutions to many common problems.</p></li>
<li><p>You should opt for encapsulation over inheritance, especially with code reuse.</p></li>

<h3>Split complex code into multiple scripts<a class="headerlink" href="#split-complex-code-into-multiple-scripts" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>Scripts are simply files containing code that you would like to execute.
In Python you commonly have a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">main.py</span></code> script that orchestrates part of your codebase to achieve an outcome.
In machine-learning projects, you sometimes have <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">train.py</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">test.py</span></code>, which are scripts that train the model and produce performance metrics.</p>
<p>Scripts, if written well, are reproducible.
In languages like R and Python, when executed from the command line using commands like <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">python</span> <span class="pre">main.py</span></code> or <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Rscript</span> <span class="pre">main.R</span></code>
they are read top to bottom and executed line by line.
This is in contrast to running code in an interactive interpreter or notebook, where the human has control of the order of execution.
Manually executing individual lines of code risks creating errors when things are run in the wrong order. Instead, it is recommend to use end-to-end scripts.</p>
<p>Ultimately for code pipelines you will need to have some way of running your code.
For this you would usually use a script. The script helps organise and run your functions and classes step by step.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>Using a script does not guarantee that your code will run reproducibly, but it does ensure that code is run in the same way across multiple runs.</p>

<section id="organise-related-classes-and-functions-into-modules">
<span id="modules"></span><h3>Organise related classes and functions into modules<a class="headerlink" href="#organise-related-classes-and-functions-into-modules" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>Simply put, modules are scripts that contain functions that you want to use in other scripts.
As you write your code and find opportunities to create classes or functions that reduce repetition and promote easier code comprehension,
you might decide that you want these functions to sit outside of your main pipeline script.
This is where modules come in, to separate reusable code into logical groups.</p>
<p>Consider a project where an analyst has created one large data analysis script.
Upon reflection, they decide to split the logic from their pipeline into groups of functions relating to ‘data processing’, ‘data modelling’, and ‘result presentation’.
They then create a file to contain each of these groups of functions: <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">processing.py</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">modelling.py</span></code>, and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">reporting.py</span></code>.
They decide that they want to have a pipeline script called <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">main</span></code>, but they want to keep this script readable and simple.
In R, it is best to also use an R project file.
Working within a project allows you to use relative file paths and avoid the need to refer to specific script locations.
Their directory now looks something similar to:</p>

<p>R projects are a really useful and simple way to organise your projects better.
However, be sure to check your settings.
R projects save history and data by default.
This is not a good idea if you are using git, as it means data can easily make its way into the version history.
To disable these options in RStudio, open the project options menu in the tools tab.
In the menu, set the options “save workspace to .RDATA on exit” and “Always save history” to “No”.
Alternatively, you can edit the .Rproj file in an editor of your choice by adding these settings:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">SaveWorkspace</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">No</span>

<p>Programming languages often come with quite a few in-built functions and classes that are available to the end-users.
However, when it comes to solving specialised problems, these in-built functions are often not enough.
In these cases, you may need to build functionality to address a given problem from scratch.
If the solutions you build are useful and reusable, you can then wrap them up in a package to allow other users to install it.
They can then reuse the work you have put in within their own code to solve similar problems.</p>
<p>Packages are self-contained collections of code written by someone else to solve a particular problem.
For example, packages like <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">dplyr</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pandas</span></code> are essential when performing data wrangling in R and Python, respectively.
They contain a toolbox of predefined functions that allows us to avoid rewriting this functionality from scratch every time.
Inside these packages is a set of <a class="reference internal" href="#organise-related-classes-and-functions-into-modules">modules</a> containing relevant functions, classes and other code that someone has written.
These are wrapped up into a package structure so that the programming language you use can understand, install and make available the code for you to import.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>This section will not cover the practices required to package and distribute your code as a package.
However if you would like to know more please look to the <a class="reference internal" href="code_documentation.html"><span class="std std-doc">code documentation section</span></a>
and seek out the packaging guides for your programming language.</p>
</div>
<p>It is useful to keep in mind the question:
is my code solving a problem that someone else has not already solved in my programming language?
If the answer is ‘Yes’ then perhaps it is worth considering wrapping up your code and distributing it wider.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>Packaging code properly will involve applying many of the recommendations in this guidance.</p>
<p>You will have to consider how to test, document and lay out your code for it to be usable and packagable.
In the end, high quality packages are the cornerstone of open-source package ecosystems.
However, it is not trivial to maintain and develop well-regarded open-source packages.</p>
<p>If you feel like you are writing code that you might consider turning into a package,
consult this guidance and strive to apply as many of the recommendations as you go.
This will make the final polishing and packaging much simpler, and will produce packages that are easier for third-parties to trust and use.</p>

<h3>Think carefully about whether notebooks are a suitable way to organise your code<a class="headerlink" href="#think-carefully-about-whether-notebooks-are-a-suitable-way-to-organise-your-code" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>Jupyter and other code Notebooks allow you to include live code alongside text and visualisation.
Although individual notebooks can seem like a good way to modularise your analysis for distribution, for larger projects this is not usually the best idea.</p>
<p>Notebooks are inherently difficult to review and audit through version control software like <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">git</span></code>.
Simple text files like scripts can be version controlled easily as you can see which lines of text change from one version to another.
Notebooks store their internal workings in a much more complicated format,
so seeing the changes as differences line by line is not possible in common version control tools.</p>
<p>Furthermore, defining and keeping functions within notebooks makes testing them more difficult.
It is not simple to test individual cells of a notebook with standard external tooling.</p>
<p>Lastly, one of the key issues with notebooks when they are used as methods for running a pipeline is the ability to run cells out of order.
In practice this means that a user can accidentally execute the steps of the analysis in the wrong order causing issues and different results.
As such, notebook results may not always be reproducible.</p>
<p>That said, great strengths of notebooks include their flexibility in displaying results while you are exploring data,
and their ability to present final research code alongside a narrative.
Therefore two good places to use notebooks in the project lifecycle is to:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Explore and ‘play’ with the data while developing your methods.</p></li>
<li><p>Turn notebooks into HTML reports to present results to end users.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In short, notebooks are not suitable for modularising analysis pipelines. However, they are a great way to do research analytics and to present results.
Therefore, as the exploratory part of your analysis draws to a close, or there is a need to produce similar analysis more regularly, it is wise to refactor notebooks.
Reusable functions and classes can be moved to modules and the main analysis pipeline might instead be reproducibly run from a script.
Here are a few suggestions to consider when refactoring code from notebooks:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Review the repetitive cells and assess which of them can be turned into reusable functions.</p></li>
<li><p>Extract existing functions into related groups, as modules.</p></li>
<li><p>Document, test and improve these functions and modules following the guidance laid out in this book.</p></li>
<li><p>Import the required functionality from these new modules into the notebook or pipeline script.</p></li>
<li><p>For new analysis, reuse functionality from these modules in new notebooks and continue to document your analytical thinking alongside your code in these notebooks.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>After this, you might turn existing notebooks into HTML to send to stakeholders, or save them as they are to enable analytical peers can re-run and review your notebooks.
The steps that you have taken to simplify your notebook code will make your code much easier to understand by readers.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that other analysts can still run notebook files out of order, so they should not be used as the main method of actually generating outputs.
Output generation should instead be trusted to scripts, where human decisions do not alter the order that code is run.</p>
