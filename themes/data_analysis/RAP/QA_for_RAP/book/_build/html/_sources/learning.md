# Learning resources

This section provides links to training and self-led learning resources, which relate to sections of the guidance.

While a few resources are listed here, many more exist online, yet these may not always follow best practice.
However, exposure to a range of applied examples will still benefit your learning.
You should compare and contrast your learning to the good practices outlined in the guidance.

## Beginner to intermediate pathways

For training relating to the topics covered in this guidance, you can visit [Statistical Programming Pathways](https://datasciencecampus.github.io/statistical_programming_training_pathways/). This open source training was developed by the Data Science Campus at the UK Office for National Statistics and has three pathways from beginner to intermediate level for coders and programmers.

[Awareness of Statistical Programming](https://datasciencecampus.github.io/statistical_programming_training_pathways/stats_pathway_awareness.html) includes training covering:
- Introduction to open source languages
- Introduction to Git

[Introduction to Statistical Programming](https://datasciencecampus.github.io/statistical_programming_training_pathways/stats_pathway_intro.html) includes training covering:
- Introduction to Python and R
- Data Visualisation in Python and R
- Statistics in Python and R
- Best practice in programming
- Modular programming

[Intermediate Statistical Programming](https://datasciencecampus.github.io/statistical_programming_training_pathways/stats_pathway_intro.html) includes training covering:
- Reproducible Reporting in Rmarkdown 
- Editing and Imputation in Python and R
- Version Control using the Command Line
- Unit Testing
- Continuous Integration
- Object Oriented Programming in Python
- Packaging and Documentation
