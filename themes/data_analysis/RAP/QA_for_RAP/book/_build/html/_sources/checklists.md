# Code quality assurance checklists

This sections aims to provide a checklist for quality assurance of analytical projects in government.

Quality assurance should be proportionate to the complexity and risk of your analysis.
With this in mind, below you can find some checklists for three levels of quality assurance.

It is recommended that you consider the risk and complexity associated with your project.
Given this assessment, you should select and tailor the checklists that are provided below.
Risk tolerance varies between organisations and government departments, so it is important that you consider the operational context for the code when deciding what quality assurance is adequate.
You may choose to select elements from each level of quality assurance to address the specific risks associated with your work.
