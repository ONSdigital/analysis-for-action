# Mortality Rates

## 1. Crude Mortality Rate {#crude-mortality-rate}

```{r crude_mortality_rate, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

# Step 1: Count the total number of deaths
# Each row in the 'deaths' dataset represents one registered death
total_deaths <- nrow(deaths)

# Step 2: Sum the total population for England and Wales
# The 'population_estimates' dataset includes population broken down by age and sex
# We filter for rows where Areatype is "E&W" (England and Wales)
# Then we sum the 'Popn' column to get the total population
total_population <- population_estimates %>%
  filter(Areatype == "E&W") %>%
  summarise(total_pop = sum(Popn, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  pull(total_pop)

# Step 3: Calculate the Crude Mortality Rate
# Formula: (Total Deaths / Total Population) * 100,000
# This gives the number of deaths per 100,000 population
crude_mortality_rate <- (total_deaths / total_population) * 100000

# Step 4: Display the result
# We round the result to 2 decimal places for readability
cat("Crude Mortality Rate (per 100,000 population):", round(crude_mortality_rate, 2), "\n")
```


## Additional: Crude Mortality Rate by Sex

```{r crude_mortality_rate_by_sex, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Step 1: Count total deaths by sex
deaths_by_sex <- deaths %>%
  group_by(SEX) %>%
  summarise(total_deaths = n(), .groups = "drop")

# Step 2: Sum population by sex for England and Wales
population_by_sex <- population_estimates %>%
  filter(Areatype == "E&W") %>%
  group_by(Sex) %>%
  summarise(total_population = sum(Popn, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = "drop")

# Step 3: Join deaths and population data by sex
crude_rate_by_sex <- deaths_by_sex %>%
  left_join(population_by_sex, by = c("SEX" = "Sex")) %>%
  mutate(
    crude_rate = round((total_deaths / total_population) * 100000, 2),
    sex_label = case_when(
      SEX == 1 ~ "Male",
      SEX == 2 ~ "Female",
      TRUE ~ "Unknown"

  cat(sep = "\n")
```

## 2. Age-Specific Mortality Rate {#age-specific-mortality-rate}

```{r age_specific_mortality_rate, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

# Step 1: Count total deaths by age group
# We group the 'deaths' dataset by Agegroup2 and count the number of records in each group.
# This gives us the total number of deaths per age group.
deaths_by_age <- deaths %>%
  group_by(Agegroup2) %>%
  summarise(total_deaths = n())

# Step 2: Sum population by age group for England and Wales
# We filter the population estimates to include only England & Wales (Areatype == "E&W"),
# then group by Agegroup2 and sum the population within each group.
population_by_age <- population_estimates %>%
  filter(Areatype == "E&W") %>%
  group_by(Agegroup2) %>%
  summarise(total_population = sum(Popn, na.rm = TRUE))

# Step 3: Join deaths and population data by age group
# We perform a left join to combine the deaths and population datasets by Agegroup2.
# This ensures all age groups from the deaths data are retained, even if population data is missing.
# We then calculate the Age-Specific Mortality Rate (ASMR) per 100,000 population.
age_specific_rates <- deaths_by_age %>%
  left_join(population_by_age, by = "Agegroup2") %>%
  mutate(ASMR = (total_deaths / total_population) * 100000)

# Step 4: Display results in a readable format
# We round the ASMR to two decimal places for clarity.
# Then, for each age group, we create a formatted string describing the ASMR.
# Finally, we print each line using cat(), which outputs to the console.
age_specific_rates %>%
  mutate(ASMR = round(ASMR, 2)) %>%
  rowwise() %>%
  mutate(
    output = paste0("Age-Specific Mortality Rate for ", Agegroup2, " (per 100,000): ", ASMR)
  ) %>%
  pull(output) %>%
  cat(sep = "\n")
```

## Additional: Age-Specific Mortality Rate by Region (England Only)

```{r age_specific_mortality_by_region, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Step 1: Filter deaths to England only and count by age group and region
deaths_by_age_region <- deaths %>%
  filter(CTRYIR == 1) %>%
  group_by(RGN, Agegroup2) %>%
  summarise(total_deaths = n(), .groups = "drop")

# Step 2: Sum population by age group and region
population_by_age_region <- population_estimates %>%
  filter(Areatype == "REG") %>%
  group_by(Code, Agegroup2) %>%
  summarise(total_population = sum(Popn, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = "drop")

# Step 3: Join deaths and population data by region and age group
age_specific_rates_region <- deaths_by_age_region %>%
  left_join(population_by_age_region, by = c("RGN" = "Code", "Agegroup2" = "Agegroup2")) %>%
  mutate(ASMR = round((total_deaths / total_population) * 100000, 2))

# Step 4: Display results grouped by age group, then region
age_specific_rates_region %>%
  arrange(Agegroup2, RGN) %>%
  rowwise() %>%
  mutate(
    output = paste0("Age Group: ", Agegroup2, " | Region Code: ", RGN, " | ASMR (per 100,000): ", ASMR)
  ) %>%
  pull(output) %>%
  cat(sep = "\n")
```

## 3. Age-Standardised Mortality Rate (ASMR) {#age-standardised-mortality-rate-asmr}

Using European Standard Population (ESP) weights  
Including confidence intervals

```{r asmr_calculation, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

# Step 0: Adjust ESP weights to match Agegroup2 format
# The ESP dataset uses "85-89" and "90+", but our mortality data uses "85+"
# To ensure consistency, we combine these two ESP groups into a single "85+" group
esp_weights_adjusted <- esp_weights %>%
  mutate(Agegroup2 = ifelse(agegroup %in% c("85-89", "90+"), "85+", agegroup)) %>%
  group_by(Agegroup2) %>%
  summarise(esp = sum(esp), .groups = "drop")

# Step 1: Count total deaths by Agegroup2
# We group the deaths dataset by Agegroup2 and count the number of deaths in each group
deaths_by_age <- deaths %>%
  group_by(Agegroup2) %>%
  summarise(total_deaths = n(), .groups = "drop")

# Step 1a: Ensure all age groups are present, even if there are zero deaths
# This is essential for accurate ASMR calculation â€” missing age groups would distort the result
# We create a complete list of age groups from the ESP weights and join it with the deaths data
# Any missing age groups will have NA for total_deaths, which we replace with 0
all_agegroups <- esp_weights_adjusted %>%
  select(Agegroup2) %>%
  distinct()

deaths_by_age_complete <- all_agegroups %>%
  left_join(deaths_by_age, by = "Agegroup2") %>%
  mutate(total_deaths = replace_na(total_deaths, 0))

# Step 2: Sum population by Agegroup2 for England and Wales
# We filter the population estimates to include only national-level data (Areatype == "E&W")
# Then we group by Agegroup2 and sum the population for each group
population_by_age <- population_estimates %>%
  filter(Areatype == "E&W") %>%
  group_by(Agegroup2) %>%
  summarise(total_population = sum(Popn, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = "drop")

# Step 3: Join deaths and population data to calculate age-specific mortality rates
# We calculate the mortality rate per 100,000 population for each age group
age_specific_rates <- deaths_by_age_complete %>%
  left_join(population_by_age, by = "Agegroup2") %>%
  mutate(rate = (total_deaths / total_population) * 100000)

# Step 4: Join with adjusted ESP weights
# This applies the standard population weights to each age-specific rate
# These weights allow us to standardise the rates across age groups
rates_with_weights <- age_specific_rates %>%
  left_join(esp_weights_adjusted, by = "Agegroup2") %>%
  mutate(weighted_rate = rate * esp)

# Step 5: Calculate the ASMR
# We sum the weighted rates and divide by the total ESP to get the standardised rate
asmr <- sum(rates_with_weights$weighted_rate, na.rm = TRUE) / sum(rates_with_weights$esp, na.rm = TRUE)

# Step 6: Calculate ASMR confidence intervals using the Dobson method
# This method estimates the variance of the ASMR using the formula:
# Var(ASMR) = sum((w_i^2 * d_i) / p_i^2), where:
# - w_i = ESP weight for age group i
# - d_i = number of deaths in age group i
# - p_i = population in age group i

rates_with_weights <- rates_with_weights %>%
  mutate(variance_component = (esp^2 * total_deaths) / (total_population^2))

# Sum variance components to get total variance
asmr_variance <- sum(rates_with_weights$variance_component, na.rm = TRUE)

# Calculate standard error and 95% confidence interval
asmr_se <- sqrt(asmr_variance)
asmr_lower <- asmr - 1.96 * asmr_se
asmr_upper <- asmr + 1.96 * asmr_se

# Step 7: Display results
# We round the ASMR and confidence interval to two decimal places for reporting
cat("Age-Standardised Mortality Rate (ASMR) for England and Wales (per 100,000):", round(asmr, 2), "\n")
cat("95% Confidence Interval (Dobson method):", round(asmr_lower, 2), "to", round(asmr_upper, 2), "\n")
```

## 4. Infant Mortality Rate (IMR) {#infant-mortality-rate}

Calculated as deaths under age 1 per 1,000 live births

```{r infant_mortality_rate, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

# Step 1: Filter deaths under age 1
# We use AGEINYRS to identify infant deaths in the deaths dataset
infant_deaths <- deaths %>%
  filter(AGEINYRS < 1)

# Step 2: Count total infant deaths
# This gives the numerator for the IMR calculation
total_infant_deaths <- nrow(infant_deaths)

# Step 3: Count total live births
# We assume each record in the births dataset represents a live birth
# This gives the denominator for the IMR calculation
total_live_births <- nrow(births)

# Step 4: Calculate Infant Mortality Rate (IMR)
# IMR = (Infant deaths / Live births) Ã— 1,000
imr <- (total_infant_deaths / total_live_births) * 1000

# Step 5: Display result
# We round the IMR to two decimal places for reporting
cat("Infant Mortality Rate (IMR) for England and Wales (per 1,000 live births):", round(imr, 2), "\n")
```


## 5. Perinatal Mortality Rate {#perinatal-mortality-rate}

Calculated as stillbirths + deaths under 7 days per 1,000 total births

```{r perinatal_mortality_rate, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

# Step 1: Identify deaths of liveborn infants under 7 days
# We use AGECUNIT == 4 (age in days) and AGEC < 7 to capture deaths
# that occurred before the infant reached 7 full days of life.
# This is the most accurate method for identifying perinatal deaths.
perinatal_deaths <- deaths %>%
  filter(AGECUNIT == 4 & AGEC < 7)

# Step 2: Count deaths under 7 days
# These are the early neonatal deaths included in the PMR calculation
total_perinatal_deaths <- nrow(perinatal_deaths)

# Step 3: Identify and count stillbirths
# SBINDZ == 1 indicates a stillbirth; SBINDZ is NULL for live births
stillbirths <- births %>%
  filter(SBIND == 1)

total_stillbirths <- nrow(stillbirths)

# Step 4: Count total births (live births + stillbirths)
# All records in the births dataset are either stillbirths or live births
total_births <- nrow(births)

# Step 5: Calculate Perinatal Mortality Rate (PMR)
# PMR = ((stillbirths + deaths under 7 days) / total births) Ã— 1,000
pmr <- ((total_stillbirths + total_perinatal_deaths) / total_births) * 1000

# Step 6: Display the PMR result
cat("Perinatal Mortality Rate (PMR) for England and Wales (per 1,000 total births):", round(pmr, 2), "\n")
```

## 6. Years of Life Lost (YLL) due to Accidents {#years-of-life-lost-yll}

Based on ICD-10 codes V01â€“X59 and ages 1â€“74

```{r yll_accidents, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

# Load stringr for string manipulation functions
library(stringr)

# Step 1: Define the ICD-10 codes that represent accidental deaths
# These codes cover unintentional injuries and are grouped as follows:
# - V01â€“V99: Transport accidents (e.g. pedestrian, cyclist, car, bus, water, air)
# - W00â€“W99: Other external causes (e.g. falls, mechanical forces, suffocation)
# - X00â€“X59: Environmental exposures and poisoning (e.g. fire, heat, drowning, poisoning)

accident_codes <- c(
  paste0("V", sprintf("%02d", 1:99)),   # Transport accidents
  paste0("W", sprintf("%02d", 0:99)),   # Falls, mechanical forces, suffocation
  paste0("X", sprintf("%02d", 0:59))    # Fire, heat, natural forces, poisoning
)

# Step 2: Filter the deaths dataset to include only:
# - Deaths where age at death is between 1 and 74 (inclusive of 1, exclusive of 75)
# - Deaths where the underlying cause (FIC10UND) matches one of the accident codes
#   We match only the first 3 characters of the ICD-10 code to account for decimal-point codes (e.g. W85.3)
accident_deaths <- deaths %>%
  filter(AGEINYRS >= 1, AGEINYRS < 75) %>%
  filter(str_sub(FIC10UND, 1, 3) %in% accident_codes)

# Step 3: Calculate Years of Life Lost (YLL) for each death
# YLL is calculated as the difference between the threshold age (75)
# and the midpoint of the age group (age + 0.5)
accident_deaths <- accident_deaths %>%
  mutate(yll = 75 - (AGEINYRS + 0.5))

# Step 4: Summarise the results
# We calculate:
# - Total YLL across all accident deaths
# - Average YLL per accident death
# - Total number of accident deaths included in the analysis
total_accident_yll <- sum(accident_deaths$yll, na.rm = TRUE)
average_accident_yll <- mean(accident_deaths$yll, na.rm = TRUE)
n_accident_deaths <- nrow(accident_deaths)

# Step 5: Display the results
cat("Number of deaths due to accidents (ages 1â€“74):", n_accident_deaths, "\n")
cat("Total Years of Life Lost (YLL) due to accidents:", round(total_accident_yll, 1), "years\n")
cat("Average YLL per accident death:", round(average_accident_yll, 1), "years\n")
```
## 7. Years of Working Life Lost (YWLL) {#years-of-working-life-lost-ywll}

Based on deaths registered in 2024 (REGYR)  
Using working-age definition from 2012 onwards: ages 16â€“64

```{r ywll_calculation, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

# Step 1: Define the working-age range for YWLL calculations
# From the 2012 data year onwards, the working-age population is defined as ages 16 to 64.
# Deaths occurring within this age range are considered premature in terms of economic and social impact.
# The upper age limit for YWLL is fixed at 65 years, representing the notional retirement age.
# Deaths at age 65 or older are excluded from this analysis.

# Step 2: Filter the deaths dataset to include only:
# - Deaths registered in the year 2024 (REGYR == 2024)
# - Deaths where age at death is between 16 and 64 (inclusive of 16, exclusive of 65)
# This ensures that only deaths within the defined working-age range are included.
working_age_deaths <- deaths %>%
  filter(REGYR == 2024, AGEINYRS >= 16, AGEINYRS < 65)

# Step 3: Calculate Years of Working Life Lost (YWLL) for each death
# YWLL is calculated as the difference between the retirement age (65)
# and the midpoint of the age at death (age + 0.5).
# This midpoint adjustment assumes deaths are evenly distributed within each age year.
# For example, a death at age 30 contributes 34.5 YWLL (i.e. 65 - 30.5).
working_age_deaths <- working_age_deaths %>%
  mutate(ywll = 65 - (AGEINYRS + 0.5))

# Step 4: Summarise the results
# We calculate:
# - Total YWLL across all deaths in the working-age range
# - Average YWLL per death (i.e. mean years lost per individual)
# - Total number of deaths included in the YWLL analysis
# These metrics provide insight into the burden of premature mortality on the workforce.
total_ywll <- sum(working_age_deaths$ywll, na.rm = TRUE)
average_ywll <- mean(working_age_deaths$ywll, na.rm = TRUE)
n_working_age_deaths <- nrow(working_age_deaths)

# Step 5: Display the results
# These figures can be used to assess the economic and social impact of premature death
# among the working-age population in England and Wales.
cat("Number of deaths in working age range (16â€“64):", n_working_age_deaths, "\n")
cat("Total Years of Working Life Lost (YWLL):", round(total_ywll, 1), "years\n")
cat("Average YWLL per death:", round(average_ywll, 1), "years\n")
```

## 8. Mean Age at Death {#mean-age-at-death}

```{r mean_age_at_death, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

# Step 1: Calculate the mean age at death
# We use AGEINYRS, which represents age in completed years
# The mean is calculated across all death records
mean_age <- deaths %>%
  summarise(mean_age = mean(AGEINYRS, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  pull(mean_age)

# Step 2: Display result
# We round the mean age to one decimal place for reporting
cat("Mean Age at Death for England and Wales:", round(mean_age, 1), "years\n")
```

## Additional: Mean Age at Death by Region

```{r mean_age_at_death_region, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Step 1: Group deaths by region and calculate mean age
# We use AGEINYRS to calculate the average age at death for each region
mean_age_by_region <- deaths %>%
  group_by(RGNNM) %>%
  summarise(mean_age_region = round(mean(AGEINYRS, na.rm = TRUE), 1), .groups = "drop")

# Step 2: Display results
# This prints the mean age at death for each region
print(mean_age_by_region)
```
## 9. Crude Rate of Years of Life Lost (YLL) due to Accidents {#crude-rate-of-yll}

Based on ICD-10 codes V01â€“X59 and ages 1â€“74  
Expressed per 100,000 population

```{r crude_rate_yll_accidents, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Step 1: Define ICD-10 codes for accidental deaths
accident_codes <- c(
  paste0("V", sprintf("%02d", 1:99)),
  paste0("W", sprintf("%02d", 0:99)),
  paste0("X", sprintf("%02d", 0:59))
)

# Step 2: Filter deaths for ages 1â€“74 and matching accident codes
library(stringr)

accident_deaths <- deaths %>%
  filter(AGEINYRS >= 1, AGEINYRS < 75) %>%
  filter(str_sub(FIC10UND, 1, 3) %in% accident_codes) %>%
  mutate(yll = 75 - (AGEINYRS + 0.5))

# Step 3: Calculate total YLL due to accidents
total_yll <- sum(accident_deaths$yll, na.rm = TRUE)

# Step 4: Extract total mid-year population for England and Wales
mid_year_pop_2024 <- population_estimates %>%
  filter(Areatype == "E&W") %>%
  summarise(total_population = sum(Popn, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  pull(total_population)

# Step 5: Calculate crude YLL rate
crude_yll_rate <- (total_yll / mid_year_pop_2024) * 100000

# Step 6: Display the result
cat("**Crude YLL rate due to accidents per 100,000 population (2024):**", round(crude_yll_rate, 1), "\n")
```

## 10. Potential Years of Life Lost (PYLL) and Standardised PYLL (SYLL) {#potential-years-of-life-lost-pyll-and-standardised-pyll-syll}

PYLL measures premature mortality by weighting deaths at younger ages more heavily  
SYLL adjusts PYLL using the 2013 European Standard Population (ESP)  
Dataset includes deaths registered in 2024 only
```{r pyll_and_syll, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Step 1: Select deaths where age at death is below 75
pyll_deaths <- deaths %>%
  filter(AGEINYRS < 75)

# Step 2: Calculate PYLL for each death
pyll_deaths <- pyll_deaths %>%
  mutate(pyll = 75 - (AGEINYRS + 0.5))

# Unit: Life Expectancy Methods & Modelling Expected Deaths and Excess Mortality

## Overview
This script is part of the ONS mortality analysis training package.  
It demonstrates two key components of mortality analysis:

1. **Life Expectancy Methods**  
   - Calculates life expectancy using a period life table approach  
   - Applies observed age-specific mortality rates to a hypothetical cohort  
   - Outputs key life table columns including `mx`, `qx`, `lx`, `dx`, `Lx`, `Tx`, and `ex`  
   - Rounds life expectancy (`ex`) to 2 decimal places for presentation  
   - References simplified and official ONS methods for calculating infant mortality (`q0`)

2. **Modelling Expected Deaths and Excess Mortality**  
   - Uses a quasi-Poisson regression to estimate expected deaths  
   - Calculates excess deaths using synthetic weekly data  
   - Visualises observed versus expected deaths for interpretation  

## Purpose
To provide practical examples of:

- Constructing a life table and calculating life expectancy  
- Preparing weekly mortality and population data for modelling  
- Fitting a quasi-Poisson regression model to estimate expected deaths  
- Calculating excess deaths for recent years  
- Creating visual outputs suitable for reporting  

## Learning Outcomes

- Understand the structure and purpose of a life table  
- Apply life table formulas to calculate life expectancy by age  
- Understand the structure of weekly mortality data  
- Apply statistical modelling to estimate expected deaths  
- Calculate excess deaths and interpret patterns  
- Create visual outputs suitable for reporting

## Life Expectancy Calculation Using Life Table Methods

### Step-by-Step Life Table Calculations
```{r life-table-calculations, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Step 1: Calculate Central Mortality Rate (mx)
# mx is the central mortality rate at each age.
# It is calculated as the number of deaths divided by the population at that age.
synthetic_life_table <- synthetic_life_table %>%
  mutate(mx = Deaths / Population)

# Step 2: Calculate Probability of Dying (qx)
# qx is the probability of dying between age x and x+1.
# For age 0 (infants), we use a simplified formula: qx = mx / (1 + mx)
# For ages 1+, we use the standard approximation: qx = (2 * mx) / (2 + mx)
#
# Note: In official ONS National Life Tables, infant mortality (q0) is calculated using
# grouped deaths under 1 year (<4 weeks, 1â€“2 months, 3â€“5 months, etc.) and matched
# monthly birth data to derive a more accurate q0. This method accounts for the uneven
# distribution of infant deaths and uses assumed average ages at death for each group.
# For training purposes, we use a simplified formula here.
synthetic_life_table <- synthetic_life_table %>%
  mutate(
    qx = case_when(
      Age == 0 ~ mx / (1 + mx),
      TRUE ~ (2 * mx) / (2 + mx)
    )
  )

# Step 3: Calculate Number of Survivors (lx)
# lx is the number of people surviving to exact age x from a starting cohort of 100,000 live births.
# We initialise lx at age 0 and calculate subsequent lx values using qx.
synthetic_life_table <- synthetic_life_table %>%
  mutate(lx = NA_real_) %>%
  mutate(lx = if_else(Age == 0, 100000, NA_real_))

for (i in 2:nrow(synthetic_life_table)) {
  synthetic_life_table$lx[i] <- synthetic_life_table$lx[i - 1] * (1 - synthetic_life_table$qx[i - 1])
}

# Step 4: Calculate Number of Deaths (dx)
# dx is the number of deaths between age x and x+1.
# It is calculated as dx = lx * qx
synthetic_life_table <- synthetic_life_table %>%
  mutate(dx = lx * qx)

# Step 5: Calculate Person-Years Lived (Lx)
# Lx is the number of person-years lived between age x and x+1.
# For most ages: Lx = (lx + lx+1) / 2
# For age 0: L0 = l1 + a0 * d0, where a0 is the average age at death in the first year (assumed 0.1)
# For the final age group: Lx = lx / mx
synthetic_life_table <- synthetic_life_table %>%
  mutate(Lx = NA_real_)

for (i in 1:(nrow(synthetic_life_table) - 1)) {
  synthetic_life_table$Lx[i] <- (synthetic_life_table$lx[i] + synthetic_life_table$lx[i + 1]) / 2
}

synthetic_life_table$Lx[1] <- synthetic_life_table$lx[2] + 0.1 * synthetic_life_table$dx[1]
synthetic_life_table$Lx[nrow(synthetic_life_table)] <- synthetic_life_table$lx[nrow(synthetic_life_table)] / synthetic_life_table$mx[nrow(synthetic_life_table)]

# Step 6: Calculate Total Person-Years Lived (Tx)
# Tx is the total number of person-years lived from age x onward.
# It is calculated as the cumulative sum of Lx from age x to the final age.
synthetic_life_table <- synthetic_life_table %>%
  mutate(Tx = NA_real_)

for (i in nrow(synthetic_life_table):1) {
  if (i == nrow(synthetic_life_table)) {
    synthetic_life_table$Tx[i] <- synthetic_life_table$Lx[i]
  } else {
    synthetic_life_table$Tx[i] <- synthetic_life_table$Tx[i + 1] + synthetic_life_table$Lx[i]
  }
}

# Step 7: Calculate Life Expectancy (ex)
# ex is the life expectancy at exact age x.
# It is calculated as ex = Tx / lx and rounded to 2 decimal places.
synthetic_life_table <- synthetic_life_table %>%
  mutate(ex = round(Tx / lx, 2))
```

### Preview Final Life Table (Pivot Style)

```{r preview_life_table, echo=FALSE, results='asis', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(knitr)

# Select key life table columns
life_table_preview <- synthetic_life_table %>%
  select(Age, mx, qx, lx, dx, Lx, Tx, ex)

# Display first 10 rows in a scrollable HTML table
cat("<div style='max-height:300px; overflow-y:auto; margin-bottom:20px;'>")
print(kable(head(life_table_preview, 10), format = "html", table.attr = "class='table table-striped'", escape = FALSE))
cat("</div>")
```

## Step 9: Visualise Life Expectancy by Age

```{r visualise_life_expectancy, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.width=14, fig.height=6}
# Create a chart showing life expectancy (ex) by age
# This visualisation helps illustrate how expected remaining years decline with age

  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, NA), expand = expansion(mult = c(0, 0.05))) +
  labs(

## Modelling Expected Deaths and Excess Mortality
### Step-by-Step Modelling Expected Deaths and Excess Mortality

```{r modelling_expected_deaths, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

## Step 1: Format Variables ----
# Convert date fields and categorical variables to appropriate formats for analysis.
# This ensures dates are recognised correctly and categorical variables are treated appropriately in modelling.
deaths <- deaths %>%
  mutate(
    week_start_date = as.Date(week_start_date),   # Convert start of week to Date format
    week_end_date = as.Date(week_end_date),       # Convert end of week to Date format
    age_group = as.factor(age_group),             # Convert age group to factor
    sex = as.factor(sex),                         # Convert sex to factor
    geography = as.factor(geography)              # Convert geography to factor
  )

population_estimates <- population_estimates %>%
  mutate(
    age_group = as.factor(age_group),             # Convert age group to factor
    sex = as.factor(sex),                         # Convert sex to factor
    geography = as.factor(geography)              # Convert geography to factor
  )

## Step 2: Merge Deaths with Population Estimates ----
# Join the weekly deaths dataset with population estimates.
# This allows each death count to be matched with the relevant population size for modelling.
merged_df <- deaths %>%
  left_join(population_estimates, by = c("year", "age_group", "sex", "geography"))

## Step 3: Create Coarse Age Groups ----
# Coarse age bands are used in seasonal interaction terms to reflect broader mortality patterns.
# These simplify the age structure for seasonal modelling while retaining key age distinctions.
merged_df <- merged_df %>%
  mutate(
    age_coarse = case_when(
      age_group %in% c("Under 1", "1-4", "5-9", "10-14", "15-19", "20-24") ~ "Under 30",
      age_group %in% c("25-29", "30-34", "35-39", "40-44", "45-49", "50-54", "55-59", "60-64", "65-69") ~ "30-69",
      TRUE ~ "70+"
    )
  )

## Step 4: Prepare Variables for Modelling ----
# Create variables needed for the statistical model:
# - weeknumber: captures seasonal variation across the year
# - timeindex: represents long-term trend across weeks
# - logpop: offset term to adjust for population size in the model
merged_df <- merged_df %>%
  mutate(
    weeknumber = lubridate::week(week_start_date),                 # Extract week number from date
    timeindex = as.numeric(as.factor(week_start_date)),            # Create numeric time index
    logpop = log(population)                                       # Log of population for offset
  )

## Step 5: Define Model Fitting and Prediction Periods ----
# Fit the model using five years of historical data (2017 to 2022).
# Predict expected deaths for 2023 and 2024 only.
training_data <- merged_df %>% filter(year >= 2017 & year <= 2022)
prediction_data <- merged_df %>% filter(year %in% c(2023, 2024))

## Step 6: Fit Quasi-Poisson Regression Model ----
# This model estimates expected deaths using:
# - demographic and geographic variables
# - a linear time trend
# - seasonal effects by week
# - interaction between age and season
# - an offset for population size
glm_model <- glm(
  deaths ~ age_group + sex + geography +
    timeindex +
    factor(weeknumber) +
    factor(age_coarse):factor(weeknumber),
  offset = logpop,
  family = quasipoisson(link = "log"),
  data = training_data
)

## Step 7: Predict Expected Deaths and Calculate Excess Deaths ----
# Use the fitted model to estimate expected deaths for 2023 and 2024.
# Excess deaths are calculated as: observed deaths minus expected deaths.
prediction_data$expected_deaths <- predict(glm_model, newdata = prediction_data, type = "response")
prediction_data$excess_deaths <- prediction_data$deaths - prediction_data$expected_deaths

## Step 8: Aggregate Weekly Totals ----
# Summarise observed, expected, and excess deaths by week, geography, age group, and sex.
# This prepares the data for visualisation and reporting.
weekly_summary <- prediction_data %>%
  group_by(year, week_end_date, geography, age_group, sex) %>%
  summarise(
    observed = sum(deaths),
    expected = sum(expected_deaths),
    excess = sum(excess_deaths),
    .groups = "drop"
  )

## Step 9: Filter for England and Wales, All Ages, People ----
# This subset is used for visualisation and reporting.
# It focuses on total deaths across all ages and sexes for England and Wales.
EW_weekly_summary_recent <- weekly_summary %>%
  filter(
    geography == "England and Wales",
    age_group == "All ages",
    sex == "people"
  )
```

## Weekly Excess Deaths Summary

It shows weekly totals for observed, expected, and excess deaths in England and Wales for 2023â€“2024.  
Useful for reporting, interpretation, and identifying patterns in excess mortality.

```{r weekly_excess_summary, echo=FALSE, results='asis', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

  head(EW_weekly_summary_recent, 20),
  format = "html",
  table.attr = "class='table table-striped'",
  caption = "Weekly Excess Deaths Summary (First 20 Weeks)"
)
```

## Visualise Observed versus Expected Deaths

```{r visualise_expected_deaths, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.width=14, fig.height=6}
# Create a chart showing:
# - observed deaths as blue bars
# - expected deaths as a black line
